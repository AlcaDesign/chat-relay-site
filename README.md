# Twitch Chat Relay Site

This server hosts a connection to a Twitch chat channel and relays those messages over a WebSocket to a front-end client for rendering. This is not a Twitch Messaging Interface (TMI) connection proxy service.

Temporarily available at [chat.alca.tv](https://chat.alca.tv) until it's replaced with a new, shinier service.
